
Overview:

Stock ticker project is a good Machine Learning Model to predict the Stock price to a reasonable accuracy using the past consumer behaviours demonstrated by comparing influencing Economic Indicators and evaluating the Best Stocks using P?E ratio.
What the project demonstrates till date:
- Visualising the "closing" values of the Stocks everyday.
- Retrieving Real time Stock data for Analysis using the "iex" (NASDAQ) Open Source API
- Generates the Stock data till date
-US Company's Stocks Comparison up to 5 at a time
- Downloading the data on the selected Stocks
- Saving the Comparison as a Image

Vision and Scope:

- will demonstrate the period over period of each Stock
- Finding the Open source "Economic Indicators" API to gather data and finding the influences on Stocks
- will compare Each Stock to Number of Economic Indicators finding trends and patters.
- will develop dynamic algorithm to do regression among the combination of Economic Indicators and Stock in order to predict the Stock value up to reasonable accuracy.
- Evaluating the growth of each stocks using P/E ratios

What makes Difference:

- spotting easy patterns and trends of each Stock with respect to Economic Indicators.
- Better validation of Consumer behaviours with changes in period over period Stats.
- Good predictive accuracy, since finding matching patters are dynamic with Machine learning Algorithms.
